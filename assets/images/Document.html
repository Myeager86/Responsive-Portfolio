            <p>Mike Yeager is a 31 year old professional and student from Boulder, CO. When he is not coding, or working, you
                can find him on the disc golf course working hard to set a new personal record. Mike is new to the coding
                and web development space, but he is learning fast and enjoying the journey.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It is his hope to take the skills he is learning in the Denver University - Coding Bootcamp to propel himself
                into a new career in web development. Mike has worked in several industries in the past 15 years including
                movie theaters, restaurants, sales, finanace and he took 4 years off to complete his bachelors degree from
                2007-2010.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now Mike has no idea what else he would like to write so he is going to fill the space with whatever comes up.
                He is coding while listening to the soundtrack for "La La Land" and giving a first listen to "The Greatest
                Showman". Hopefully this is enough text to now have wrapped around the picture of himself and show that he
                understand the float, postion, and margin properties.
            </p>
