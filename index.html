            <p>Mike Yeager is a 31 year old professional and student from Boulder, CO. When I am not coding, or working, you
                can find me on the disc golf course working hard to set a new personal record. I am new to the coding
                and web development space, but learning fast and enjoying the journey.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>It is my hope to take the skills I am learning in the Denver University - Coding Bootcamp to propel myself
                into a new career in web development. I have worked in several industries in the past 16 years including
                entertainment, restaurants, sales, and finanace. I took 4 years off to complete his bachelors degree from
                2007-2010.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout the coding bootcamp I was exposed to a wide variety of languages and libraries. The bootcamp taught
                me many things, one of the most important being self reliance and the ability to find information I am missing \
                by searching it out on various coding sites and plain old Google. Of all the languges and libraries I learned, I 
                enjoyed the backend work (Express, Node, Handlebars, etc) the most, React is also incredibly powerful and useful 
                and I look forward to delving into the codebase further. 
            </p>
